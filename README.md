# tuple_iterator
A "proof-of-concept" attempt at a standards-compliant implementation of an iterator for `std::tuple`.

## Environment
The code was developed on `macOS Mojave (v10.14.3)`, that's why my Makefile relies on `clang++`. You should be able to replace `clang++` with any C++17-compliant compiler, however, to play with the code yourself!
