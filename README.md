# tuple_iterator
An attempt at a standards-compliant implementation of an iterator for `std::tuple`.

## Environment
This code was developed on `macOS Mojave (v10.14.3)`. That's why my Makefile relies on `clang++`, although, you should be able to replace `clang++` with any C++17-compliant compiler to play with it yourself!
